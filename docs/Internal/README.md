# Internal Documentation

This folder contains some documentation about implementation details. As with
any internal details, these are subject to change (i.e. this isn't a
specification), however, as some of the processes are not straight forward the
documentation aims to be a useful starting point when diagnosing issues or for
expanding the framework.
